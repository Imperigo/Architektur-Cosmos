# Deployment & Production Context

This file documents how this app is hosted in production, so that any code
change can be made with full awareness of the runtime environment.

**For Codex (and any future AI agent working on this repo)**: read this
before suggesting changes that touch build, runtime, or data layer.

---

## TL;DR — "publish this" / "make it live"

**Every push to `main` is automatically deployed.** There is no manual deploy
step. When the user says "publish", "deploy", "make it live", or similar:

1. Make sure changes are committed
2. Push to `main`
3. Cloudflare detects the push within seconds and rebuilds
4. Live at `https://architekturkosmos.ch` (or `architekturkosmos.andrin99zsc.workers.dev` until DNS finishes propagating) in 1–3 minutes
5. Verify by visiting the URL

If a build fails, the previous version stays live (no broken deployments).

## Production Architecture

| Component | Tech | Location |
|---|---|---|
| Hosting | **Cloudflare Workers (Static Assets mode)** | edge, global |
| Worker name | `architekturkosmos` | CF account `andrin99zsc@gmail.com` |
| Production URL (Workers) | `architekturkosmos.andrin99zsc.workers.dev` | always available |
| Custom domain | `architekturkosmos.ch` | ✅ live (since 2026-05-18) |
| Custom domain (www) | `www.architekturkosmos.ch` | live alongside apex |
| Build runtime | Node 22 (CF build env) | CF cloud builders |
| Deploy tool | `wrangler` (version pinned to latest by CF) | auto-installed |
| Auto-deploy trigger | GitHub push to `main` | CF Pages GitHub integration |

There is **no separate backend** right now. The site is fully static:
all entries are bundled from `data/mock-entries.json` at build time.

---

## Build Pipeline (what happens on every push)

1. CF Pages clones the repo at `main`
2. Runs `npm clean-install`
3. Runs `npm run build` (which runs `next build`)
4. Next.js produces a static export in `./out/` (because `next.config.js` has `output: 'export'`)
5. Runs `npx wrangler deploy`
6. Wrangler reads `wrangler.jsonc` → sees `assets.directory: "./out"` → uploads `./out/` as Workers Static Assets
7. New version becomes the active deployment

**Critical config files** (do not modify casually):

- **`next.config.js`** — must keep `output: 'export'`, `trailingSlash: true`, `images: { unoptimized: true }` for static export to work
- **`wrangler.jsonc`** — must keep `assets.directory: "./out"`, no `main` entry (would trigger Worker code deploy)
- **`package.json`** name (`architektur-cosmos-browser`) — does NOT need to match the CF Worker name (`architekturkosmos`); a previous setup attempt failed because of this mismatch, the current static-assets-only setup avoids the issue

## What this means for code changes

### ✅ Safe to change without deployment implications
- Components in `components/`, `app/` routes, `lib/` helpers
- Tailwind classes, styling
- New static pages (e.g., `app/about/page.tsx`)
- New entries in `data/mock-entries.json`
- TypeScript types in `lib/types.ts`
- Adding client-side libraries (D3, framer-motion, etc.)

### ⚠️ Touch with care (still works on static, but think through)
- **`generateStaticParams`** for dynamic routes — yes, this works with static export. Use it for things like `app/atlas/[slug]/page.tsx` to pre-render per-entry pages.
- **Client components** — fine, but make sure they degrade gracefully if JS is disabled (SEO-relevant)
- **Image sources** — keep `images: { unoptimized: true }` in next.config.js or use external CDN; Next.js Image Optimization API doesn't work on static export
- **Font loading** — `next/font` works, just verify bundle stays reasonable

### ❌ Will break the static build
- **Server Components with async data fetching from external APIs** at request time (`fetch` with `cache: 'no-store'`) — these need server runtime, not available on static export
- **API routes** (`app/api/.../route.ts`) — would fail to build with `output: 'export'`
- **Server Actions** — same
- **`redirect()` from `next/navigation`** at module top-level — breaks build
- **Middleware** — not supported on static export
- **ISR/`revalidate`** — no-op on static export, won't error but doesn't do anything

### 🚀 If you need any of the ❌ items
That means the app is outgrowing static export. Then the migration path is:
1. Remove `output: 'export'` from `next.config.js`
2. Add `main` entry to `wrangler.jsonc` pointing to `@opennextjs/cloudflare` worker
3. Install `@opennextjs/cloudflare` adapter
4. Change deploy to `npx opennextjs-cloudflare build && npx wrangler deploy`

But don't do this preemptively — flag it to the user first ("this change would require switching to OpenNext.js, ok?").

## Local Development

Unchanged from any Next.js project:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # http://localhost:3000
npm run build        # produces ./out/, mirrors what CF will do
npm run lint
```

No environment variables needed currently.

## Future: DB Integration

When the architecture demands more than static data (CMS-style editing, large
entry counts, search, etc.), the planned path is:

1. **Database**: Postgres (self-hosted on user's home server, separate project)
2. **Connection**: env var `DATABASE_URL` (only set in production)
3. **DB client**: `postgres` (postgres.js — slim, async-first)
4. **Pattern**: `lib/db.ts` returns null when `DATABASE_URL` unset → callers fall back to `data/mock-entries.json` so `npm run dev` keeps working without DB
5. **Runtime switch**: drop `output: 'export'`, switch to OpenNext.js deploy

Ready-to-copy patches for this migration live in the user's separate
`architektur-server` repo under `cosmos-patches/`. When DB integration becomes
relevant, the user will either copy them in or ask Codex to integrate them.

**For now: do not add DB code.** Stay with static + mock JSON.

## SEO / Search Engine Indexing

The site is meant to be indexable. When adding pages:

- Use `metadata` export in each `page.tsx` (Next.js Metadata API) for title/description/og-image
- Per-entry detail pages (`app/atlas/[slug]/page.tsx`) significantly help indexing — currently missing
- A `sitemap.ts` and `robots.ts` in `app/` would help — currently missing
- Structured data (JSON-LD with schema.org Building/Place) for entries would help — currently missing

These improvements are welcome PRs. They don't require any infra changes.
